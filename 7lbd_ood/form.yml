      This field specifies how many hours to reserve the cluster node for.  At the end of your reservation, your processes will be killed without notice.  It may be a good idea to ask for more time than you think you will need, but longer reservations may take more time to become available.
  bc_email_on_started:
    value: true
    help: |
      Reservations for large numbers of resources or for longer periods of time may take a while to become available.  Checking this box will allow us to send you an email when the resource becomes available.
  auto_queues:
    help: |
      This controls where your job will run. Select "(auto)" unless you have a particular need.
